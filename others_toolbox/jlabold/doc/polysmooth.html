 <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>  Smoothing scattered 2D data with local polynomial fitting.
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> generates a map from scattered data in two dimensions---
    either on the plane or on the sphere---using a local least squares fit 
    to a polynomial. 
 
    A numerically efficient algorithm is used that avoids explicit loops. 
    Also, the data are pre-sorted so that different mapping parameters can 
    be tried out at little computational expense.
 
    A reference paper for this function is currently in preparation.  In 
    the meantime, for more details see the following book:
 
       Fan and Gijbels, 1996.  Local polynomial modelling and its 
           applications. Chapman and Hall.

    Smoothing on the plane
 
    Let's say we have an array Z of data is at locations X,Y, where X,Y, 
    and Z are all arrays of the same size.  The problem is to obtain a 
    mapped field ZHAT on some regular grid specified by arrays XO and YO.
 
    Calling <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> is a two-step process: 
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS]=<a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a>(X,Y,Z,XO,YO,CUTOFF);
        ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P);
 
    Firstly, <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> which returns ZS, a 3D array of data values at each 
    grid point, sorted by increasing distance DS, and the corresponding 
    positions XS and YS. Here XO and YO are arrays specifying the bin 
    center locations of the grid.  See <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> for more details.
   
    Here CUTOFF determines the maximum distance included in the sorting 
    and should be chosen to be greater than B.  
 
    Secondly, <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> fits a Pth order polynomial at each gridpoint 
    within a neighborhood specified by the "bandwidth" B.  
 
    Data and grid point locations are presumed to have the same units as
    the bandwidth B (e.g., kilometers).
 
    P may be chosen as P=0 (fit to a constant), P=1 (fit to a plane), or
    else P=2 (fit to a parabolic surface).  
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> can also be used for data on the sphere, as described next.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Smoothing on the sphere
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> supports a local polynomial fit on the sphere.  As before 
    this is a two-step process:
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS]=<a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,Z,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF);
        ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P,'sphere') 
 
    Firstly one calls <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>, which is the analogue of <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> for the 
    sphere.  LATO and LONO are arrays specifying the bin center locations 
    of the grid.  See <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> for more details.
 
    Secondly, <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> fits a Pth order polynomial at each gridpoint 
    within a neighborhood specified by the "bandwidth" B.  The bandwidth 
    here should have units of kilometers. 
 
    Note that <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> and <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> both assume the sphere to be the 
    radius of the earth, as specified by the function <a href="radearth.html">RADEARTH</a>.
    __________________________________________________________________
   
    Additional options
    
    A number of different options are possible, as descibed below.  These  
    are specified with trailing string arguments, which can be given in any
    order provided they are after the numeric arguments.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Weighting function
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> weights the data points in the vicinity of each grid point
    according to some decaying function of distance.
 
    1) Parabolic weighting
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,'epa'), the default behavior, uses the Epanechnikov  
    kernel --- a fancy name for a parabolic weighting function.  This  
    function vanishes outside a radius of the bandwidth B.  
 
    The Epanechnikov kernel has the numerical advantage that distances from 
    far away points do not have to be computed, and is therefore preferred.
 
    2) Gaussian weighting:
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,'gau') uses a Gaussian weighting function instead, with 
    a standard deviation of B and truncated, for numerical reasons, at a 
    radius of 3B.  
 
    When using the Gaussian weighting function you'll need to call TWODSORT
    or <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> with a cutoff distance of at least 3B.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Algorithms 
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> has two algorithm choices for optimal performance, both of 
    which give identical answers.
 
    1) Speed optimization
 
    The default algorithm is optimized for speed but uses a great deal of 
    memory.  It solves the least squares problem for all grid points
    simultaneously (by directly solving matrix inversions---see <a href="matinv.html">MATINV</a>.)
 
    This can be greater than an order of magnitude faster than the obvious 
    approach of looping over the grid points.
  
    2) Memory optimization
 
    If the data is so large that memory becomes a limiting factor, use
 
        ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,B,P,'memory');
   
    which performs an explicit loop. 
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Weighted data points
 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> can also incorporate a weighting factor on the data points.
    Let W be an array of positive values the same size as the data array Z.  
    Each data point is then treated as if it were W data points.
 
    To use weighted data points, call <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> or <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> with W added:
 
        [DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS]=<a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a>(X,Y,Z,W,XO,YO,CUTOFF);           
     or [DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS]=<a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,Z,W,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF); 
     
    followed by    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS,B,P);
             or    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(DS,XS,YS,ZS,WS,B,P,'sphere');
 
    for data distributed on the plane or on the sphere, respectively.
 
    For very large datasets, this is useful in first condensing the data
    into a manageable size.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Additional output arguments
 
    [ZHAT,WEIGHT]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) also returns the total weight used in 
    the computation at each grid point.  WEIGHT is the same size as ZHAT.
 
    Small weights mean that only few or far away data points contributed
    to the calculation; therefore, the values of ZHAT at these points
    are less reliable than at points where the total weight is large.
 
    [ZHAT,WEIGHT,BETA]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...) additionally returns the matrix
    of the estimated first P derivatives.  BETA is 3D and is the same 
    size as ZHAT and WEIGHT along its first two dimensions.
 
    BETA(:,:,1) is the estimated zeroth derivative, i.e. the surface, so
    this is the same as ZHAT.
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Variable bandwidth
 
    ZHAT=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,N,P,'variable') uses the parameter N instead of a
    fixed bandwidth.  The bandwidth now varies over the grid such that N
    points fall within one bandwidth distance from every grid point.
    
    [ZHAT,WEIGHT,BETA,B]=<a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>(...,N,P,'variable') returns the 
    bandwidth B at each grid point, which is the same size as ZHAT.  
 
    The variable bandwidth algorithm can give good results when the data
    spacing is highly uneven, particularly when used with a higher-order
    (P=1 or P=2) fit.  
 
    When using the variable bandwidth method, be aware that the bandwidth
    necessary to include N points may turn out to be larger than CUTOFF,
    the maximum distance value given to <a href="twodsort.html">TWODSORT</a> or <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>.
